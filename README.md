# üÖøÔ∏è Next.js Domain Parking Template

If you have a domain that you're not using like me, you can use this template to create a simple website that displays the domain for sale. This template includes a contact form that allows users to send messages via email. Upon form submission, an email is sent using Resend. Deploy this template with Vercel, configure the environment variables, and set up your domain to point to the Vercel deployment to start parking your domain.

## Deploy with Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbqst%2Fnextjs-domain-parking-template&env=NEXT_PUBLIC_URL,EMAIL_FROM,EMAIL_TO,RESEND_API_KEY&envDescription=Required%20environment%20variables%20for%20the%20Next.js%20Domain%20Parking%20Template&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbqst%2Fnextjs-domain-parking-template%23installation)

You can host multiple domains in one Vercel project by setting the `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL` environment variable to `https://$NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL`. This will allow you to deploy the same codebase to multiple domains and have the website display the correct domain name.
